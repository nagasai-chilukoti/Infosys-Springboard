This model is deployed using Hugging face, open source deployment tool.The application runs on Gradio. Gradio is a powerful Python library that makes it easy to deploy machine learning models through simple web interfaces. In this deployment, users can upload an image of the iris and the system analyzes it to determine if a tumor is present. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, featuring drag-and-drop functionality for uploading images and displaying clear text predictions as output.  Gradio's intuitive design streamlines the process of showcasing machine learning models and sharing them with others.


*About the project:*

Iris tumors are among the smallest cystic tumors associated with cancer, making their identification particularly challenging due to their diminutive size. If not addressed in the early stages, these tumors can lead to irreversible blindness. To facilitate the diagnosis of iris tumors, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are utilized. The model is trained with images from both healthy individuals and those with tumors, which undergo preprocessing prior to analysis. The convolutional layers assign weights to the input pixels to determine whether the image represents a healthy or affected eye. The use of CNNs allows for the extraction of intricate features from the input images, enabling the detection of subtle abnormalities that might be overlooked by manual examination. Advanced data augmentation techniques are employed during training to improve model robustness and ensure reliable performance across diverse image variations. Furthermore, the integration of this technology into clinical workflows can provide ophthalmologists with real-time diagnostic support, paving the way for early intervention and improved patient outcomes.


*Datasets*

The data is collected from  The Rayid Method Of Iris Analysis Miles Research
