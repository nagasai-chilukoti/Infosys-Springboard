This model is deployed using **Streamlit**, an open-source Python framework that makes it easy to build and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In this project, users can upload an image of the iris, and the system analyzes it to determine whether a tumor is present. The interface is designed to be clean and user-friendly, allowing users to drag and drop images and view clear classification results. Streamlit’s simplicity and flexibility make it an ideal tool for deploying deep learning models and sharing them with the community or clinical professionals.

### 🧠 *About the Project*

Iris tumors are rare and tiny growths that can appear on the iris, and due to their small size, early detection is extremely difficult. If left untreated, they can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness. This project aims to assist in the early identification of iris tumors using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on labeled eye images.

The model processes eye images and identifies whether they are healthy or show signs of a tumor. It uses CNN-based architecture to extract subtle and complex features that may not be visible through manual inspection. The training dataset includes images from both healthy individuals and patients with iris tumors. These images are preprocessed and augmented to ensure robust and generalized performance across a variety of image conditions.

By integrating this tool into medical workflows, ophthalmologists can receive AI-based support for early tumor diagnosis, ultimately helping improve patient care through faster and more accurate assessments.
